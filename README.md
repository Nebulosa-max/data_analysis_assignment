# Data Analysis Assignment â€“ Wine Dataset

This repository contains my solutions for the Principles of Data Analytics assignment.

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to perform exploratory data analysis on the Wine dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Contents

- `penguins.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code and analysis
- Summary statistics for each feature by wine class (mean, standard deviation, range)
- Visualisations of feature distributions (histograms)
- Scatter plots comparing feature relationships, colored by wine class

## Tools Used

- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

## Notes

- Due to technical issues with my local Jupyter environment, I used Google Colab to complete this work.
- The analysis was completed through focused effort, research, and exploration, aiming to understand both the data and the tools used.

## Problem Summary

- **Problem 1**: Dataset loaded and explored using `shape`, `head`, and `describe()`
- **Problem 2**: Summary statistics calculated for each feature grouped by class
- **Problem 3**: Histograms plotted to explore distributions
- **Problem 4**: Scatter plots created to analyse feature relationships and class separation
