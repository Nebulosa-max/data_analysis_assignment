# Data Analysis Assignment â€“ Wine Dataset

This repository contains my solutions for the Principles of Data Analytics assignment.

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to perform exploratory data analysis on the Wine dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Contents

- `penguins.ipynb` or `problems.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code and analysis.
- Summary statistics for each feature by wine class (mean, standard deviation, range).
- A visualisation of the mean values across all wine classes using a grouped bar chart.

## Tools Used

- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

## Notes

- Due to technical issues with my local Jupyter environment, I used Google Colab to complete this work.
- All work is my own and each task has been completed step by step with full understanding.
